Step 10 - Submit your work
Even though you have posted your file on GitHub, you still need to submit your Python script and Word document as a Canvas assignment for grading. So, place your document and python script in the Assignment07 folder. Zip this folder into a “.zip” file, then upload the .zip file to the class assignment page.

```
print('asdf')
```
